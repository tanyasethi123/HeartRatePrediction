This project is used to predict heart health of a person. After analysing and pre-processing the datasets using three data mining techniques namely Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes, the health of a person was detected. 
The prediction is based on various attributes including blood pressure, age and blood sugar levels.
This project is in python and data is saved using SQL db.
